This program simply does conversion from Two's Complement.
The two's-complement representation must be in 32-bit hex (8 hex digits).
For example, 0xFFFFFFFF is -1.

Two's-complement is the most common method of internally representing signed
integers on computers. The two's complement of a binary number is defined as
the value obtained by subtracting the number from a large power of two.
