School Projects
===============

A collection of some of my school work from my days of studying computer science
at university.

Here be dragons
---------------

Be warned. Code may be messy, incomplete, buggy, or wrong.

This repository serves as a useful reminder for how far I've come
since my first day at university when I knew practically nothing.

I may cringe looking back at my old work, but that's a good thing. If there's
ever a time when I don't, that means I've stopped improving.

Other school work
