School Projects
===============

A collection of some of my school work from my days of studying computer science
at university.

Here be dragons
---------------

Be warned. Code may be messy, incomplete, buggy, or wrong.

This repository serves as a useful reminder about how far I've come.
I remember switching labs for my intro to programming course because the lab
leader laughed at me when I asked a noob question. Well, I'm glad I didn't drop out.

I may cringe looking back at my old work, but that's a good thing. If there's
ever a time when I don't cringe looking at my old work, that means I've stopped
improving.

Other school work
