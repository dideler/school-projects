School Projects
===============

A collection of some of my school work from my days of studying computer science
at university.

Here be dragons

Be warned. Code may be messy, incomplete, buggy, or wrong.

This repository serves as a useful reminder about how far I've come.
I had to switch labs for my intro to programming course because the lab
leader laughed at me when I had trouble with some basic concept (I think
it was a for-loop). Well, I'm glad I didn't drop out.

I may cringe looking back at my old work, but that's a good thing. If there's
ever a time when I don't cringe looking at my old work, that means I've stopped
improving.
