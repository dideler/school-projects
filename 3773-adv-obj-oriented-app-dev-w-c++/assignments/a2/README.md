Assignment 2
------------

Based on the book *C++ Programming with Design Patterns Revealed*

Diagrams made with Dia 0.97.2.

Code tested with gcc version 4.7.3.
You need minimum GCC 4.5, otherwise try Clang.  
Run `make` to build the executables.

#### UML class diagram for exercise 3.7
> Repeat exercise 3.6, but this time use pointers to `Point`s rather than nested
> objects in the class `Cube`.

Note that the code for exercise 3.7 was provided to me.

#### UML class diagram for exercise 3.8
> Write a class `Employee` that represents an employee with three attributes:
> 1. name
> 2. salary
> 3. ID
> ID numbers for new employees are assigned values 1000, 1001, ... and so on.
> Also write the following classes.
> - `Company1`, which represents a company that can hire up to 10 employees.
>   The employees are stored in an array.
> - `Company2`, which represents a company that can hire up to _n_ employees,
>   where the value of _n_ is determined in the constructor. The employees are
>   stored in an array.

Note that the code for exercise 3.8 was provided to me.

#### Exercise 4.4 (w/ namespaces)
> Implement the code for exercise 3.9 (see assignment 1) so it provides
> instantiating operations to create objects. Hint: use Idiom 4.2

#### Exercise 4.6
> Use a singleton design pattern and implement the code for exercise 3.8 to
> allow at most one instance of `Company1` and at most two instances of
> `Company2`.
