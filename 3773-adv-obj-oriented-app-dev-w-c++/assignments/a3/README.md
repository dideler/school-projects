Assignment 3
------------

Based on the book *C++ Programming with Design Patterns Revealed*

Code tested with clang++ version 3.2.
g++ (minimum GCC 4.5) should also work.  
Run `make` to build the executables.

#### Exercise 5.11
> Write the class `Queue`, similar to the class `IntStack` from example 5.3,
> in which the elements of the queue are stored in an array. This class should
> be stored in a namespace and use exception handling.

#### Exercise 5.13
> Write a class derived from the class `BenchmarkClass` from example 5.4 to
> benchmark two sorting algorithms for `double` values stored in the array:
> bubble sort and quick sort.
