COMP 3773: Advanced Object Oriented Application Development with C++

This is an online course offered by Acadia University,
which I took as a visiting student.

It's basically programming with design patterns in C++.

I've included the programs that come with the textbook, for educational reasons.
You can find them in `[programs/](programs/)`. I've modified all their source
code to improve the formatting and fix minor bugs.
