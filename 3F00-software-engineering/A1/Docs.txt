Program written, compiled and tested on Linux (Kubuntu and CentOS).

To compile:
On a Linux environment (such as CentOS in the labs)...
1) open up the terminal (applications > accessories > terminal)
2) go to the directory in which the assignment is in (cd command changes directory)
3) run the compile script; type (without the quotation marks) "sh ./compileList.sh"
4) to run the executable, type (without the quatation marks) "./test"
5) optional step: to run in gdb (debugger), type "gdb test"

Functions:
1. deleteCurrent: the deletion of the current element (which should raise an error if the list is empty)
2. getCurrent: inspection of the contents of the current element (again, an error condition is possible here)
3. nextNode: making the next element current
4. prevNode: making the previous element current
5. insertBefore: insertion of a new element before current
6. insertAfter: insertion of a new element after current
7. isListEmpty: test if the list is empty
8. getSize: returns size of list
